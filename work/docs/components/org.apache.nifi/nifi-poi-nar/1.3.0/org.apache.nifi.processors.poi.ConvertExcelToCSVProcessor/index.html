Each sheet from the incoming Excel document will generate a new Flowfile that will be output from this processor. Each output Flowfile's contents will be formatted as a csv file where the each row from the excel sheet is output as a newline in the csv file. This processor is currently only capable of processing .xlsx (XSSF 2007 OOXML file format) Excel documents and not older .xls (HSSF '97(-2007) file format) documents. This processor also expects well formatted CSV content and will not escape cell's containing invalid content such as newlines or additional commas.</p><h3>Tags: </h3><p>excel, csv, poi</p><h3>Properties: </h3><p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear in <strong>bold</strong>.
