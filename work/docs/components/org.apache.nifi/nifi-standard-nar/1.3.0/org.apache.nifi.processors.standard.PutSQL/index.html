The content of an incoming FlowFile is expected to be the SQL command to execute. The SQL command may use the ? to escape parameters. In this case, the parameters to use must exist as FlowFile attributes with the naming convention sql.args.N.type and sql.args.N.value, where N is a positive integer. The sql.args.N.type is expected to be a number indicating the JDBC Type. The content of the FlowFile is expected to be in UTF-8 format.</p><h3>Tags: </h3><p>sql, put, rdbms, database, update, insert, relational</p><h3>Properties: </h3><p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear in <strong>bold</strong>.

If the fragment.count value is greater than 1, the Processor will not process any FlowFile with that fragment.identifier until all are available; at that point, it will process all FlowFiles with that fragment.identifier as a single transaction, in the order specified by the FlowFiles' fragment.index attributes. This Provides atomicity of those SQL statements. If this value is false, these attributes will be ignored and the updates will occur independent of one another.</td></tr><tr><td id="name">Transaction Timeout</td><td id="default-value"></td><td id="allowable-values"></td><td id="description">If the &lt;Support Fragmented Transactions&gt; property is set to true, specifies how long to wait for all FlowFiles for a particular fragment.identifier attribute to arrive before just transferring all of the FlowFiles with that identifier to the 'failure' relationship</td></tr><tr><td id="name"><strong>Batch Size</strong></td><td id="default-value">100</td><td id="allowable-values"></td><td id="description">The preferred number of FlowFiles to put to the database in a single transaction</td></tr><tr><td id="name">Obtain Generated Keys</td><td id="default-value">false</td><td id="allowable-values"><ul><li>true</li><li>false</li></ul></td><td id="description">If true, any key that is automatically generated by the database will be added to the FlowFile that generated it using the sql.generate.key attribute.

By default (false), if an error occurs while processing a FlowFile, the FlowFile will be routed to 'failure' or 'retry' relationship based on error type, and processor can continue with next FlowFile. Instead, you may want to rollback currently processed FlowFiles and stop further processing immediately. In that case, you can do so by enabling this 'Rollback On Failure' property.  If enabled, failed FlowFiles will stay in the input relationship without penalizing it and being processed repeatedly until it gets processed successfully or removed by other means. It is important to set adequate 'Yield Duration' to avoid retrying too frequently.</td></tr></table><h3>Relationships: </h3><table id="relationships"><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>retry</td><td>A FlowFile is routed to this relationship if the database cannot be updated but attempting the operation again may succeed</td></tr><tr><td>success</td><td>A FlowFile is routed to this relationship after the database is successfully updated</td></tr><tr><td>failure</td><td>A FlowFile is routed to this relationship if the database cannot be updated and retrying the operation will also fail, such as an invalid query or an integrity constraint violation</td></tr></table><h3>Reads Attributes: </h3><table id="reads-attributes"><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>fragment.identifier</td><td>If the &lt;Support Fragment Transactions&gt; property is true, this attribute is used to determine whether or not two FlowFiles belong to the same transaction.</td></tr><tr><td>fragment.count</td><td>If the &lt;Support Fragment Transactions&gt; property is true, this attribute is used to determine how many FlowFiles are needed to complete the transaction.</td></tr><tr><td>fragment.index</td><td>If the &lt;Support Fragment Transactions&gt; property is true, this attribute is used to determine the order that the FlowFiles in a transaction should be evaluated.</td></tr><tr><td>sql.args.N.type</td><td>Incoming FlowFiles are expected to be parametrized SQL statements.

The value of the Parameters are specified as sql.args.1.value, sql.args.2.value, sql.args.3.value, and so on. The type of the sql.args.1.value Parameter is specified by the sql.args.1.type attribute.</td></tr><tr><td>sql.args.N.format</td><td>This attribute is always optional, but default options may not always work for your data. Incoming FlowFiles are expected to be parametrized SQL statements. In some cases a format option needs to be specified, currently this is only applicable for binary data types and timestamps. For binary data types available options are 'ascii', 'base64' and 'hex'.  In 'ascii' format each string character in your attribute value represents a single byte, this is the default format and the format provided by Avro Processors. In 'base64' format your string is a Base64 encoded string.  In 'hex' format the string is hex encoded with all letters in upper case and no '0x' at the beginning. For timestamps, the format can be specified according to java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter.Customer and named patterns are accepted i.e. ('yyyy-MM-dd','ISO_OFFSET_DATE_TIME')</td></tr></table><h3>Writes Attributes: </h3><table id="writes-attributes"><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>sql.generated.key</td><td>If the database generated a key for an INSERT statement and the Obtain Generated Keys property is set to true, this attribute will be added to indicate the generated key, if possible.
