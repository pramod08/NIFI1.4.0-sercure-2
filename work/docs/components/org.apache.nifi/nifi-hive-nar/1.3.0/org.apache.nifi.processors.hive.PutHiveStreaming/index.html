The incoming flow file is expected to be in Avro format and the table must exist in Hive. Please see the Hive documentation for requirements on the Hive table (format, partitions, etc.). The partition values are extracted from the Avro record based on the names of the partition columns as specified in the processor.</p><h3>Tags: </h3><p>hive, streaming, put, database, store</p><h3>Properties: </h3><p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear in <strong>bold</strong>.

Without this, Hadoop will search the classpath for a 'hive-site.xml' file or will revert to a default configuration.

Please see the Hive documentation for more details.</td></tr><tr><td id="name"><strong>Database Name</strong></td><td id="default-value"></td><td id="allowable-values"></td><td id="description">The name of the database in which to put the data.</td></tr><tr><td id="name"><strong>Table Name</strong></td><td id="default-value"></td><td id="allowable-values"></td><td id="description">The name of the database table in which to put the data.</td></tr><tr><td id="name">Partition Columns</td><td id="default-value"></td><td id="allowable-values"></td><td id="description">A comma-delimited list of column names on which the table has been partitioned.

By default (false), if an error occurs while processing a FlowFile, the FlowFile will be routed to 'failure' or 'retry' relationship based on error type, and processor can continue with next FlowFile. Instead, you may want to rollback currently processed FlowFiles and stop further processing immediately. In that case, you can do so by enabling this 'Rollback On Failure' property.  If enabled, failed FlowFiles will stay in the input relationship without penalizing it and being processed repeatedly until it gets processed successfully or removed by other means. It is important to set adequate 'Yield Duration' to avoid retrying too frequently.NOTE: When an error occurred after a Hive streaming transaction which is derived from the same input FlowFile is already committed, (i.e. a FlowFile contains more records than 'Records per Transaction' and a failure occurred at the 2nd transaction or later) then the succeeded records will be transferred to 'success' relationship while the original input FlowFile stays in incoming queue. Duplicated records can be created for the succeeded ones when the same FlowFile is processed again.</td></tr><tr><td id="name">Kerberos Principal</td><td id="default-value"></td><td id="allowable-values"></td><td id="description">Kerberos principal to authenticate as.

Note that some records may have been processed successfully, they will be routed (as Avro flow files) to the success relationship.

This can be used to provide a retry capability since full rollback is not possible.</td></tr><tr><td>success</td><td>A FlowFile containing Avro records routed to this relationship after the record has been successfully transmitted to Hive.</td></tr><tr><td>failure</td><td>A FlowFile containing Avro records routed to this relationship if the record could not be transmitted to Hive.</td></tr></table><h3>Reads Attributes: </h3>None specified.<h3>Writes Attributes: </h3><table id="writes-attributes"><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>hivestreaming.record.count</td><td>This attribute is written on the flow files routed to the 'success' and 'failure' relationships, and contains the number of records from the incoming flow file written successfully and unsuccessfully, respectively.</td></tr></table><h3>State management: </h3>This component does not store state.<h3>Restricted: </h3>This component is not restricted.</body></html>
