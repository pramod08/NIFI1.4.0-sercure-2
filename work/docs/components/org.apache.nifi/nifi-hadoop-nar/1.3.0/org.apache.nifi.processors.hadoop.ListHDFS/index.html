Each time a listing is performed, the files with the latest timestamp will be excluded and picked up during the next execution of the processor. This is done to ensure that we do not miss any files, or produce duplicates, in the cases where files with the same timestamp are written immediately before and after a single execution of the processor. For each file that is listed in HDFS, this processor creates a FlowFile that represents the HDFS file to be fetched in conjunction with FetchHDFS. This Processor is designed to run on Primary Node only in a cluster. If the primary node changes, the new Primary Node will pick up where the previous node left off without duplicating all of the data. Unlike GetHDFS, this Processor does not delete any data from HDFS.</p><h3>Tags: </h3><p>hadoop, HDFS, get, list, ingest, source, filesystem</p><h3>Properties: </h3><p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear in <strong>bold</strong>.
